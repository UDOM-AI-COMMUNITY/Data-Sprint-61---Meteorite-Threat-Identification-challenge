# Data-Sprint-61---Meteorite-Threat-Identification-challenge
A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space.To date, Nearly 28,000 near-Earth objects have been discovered by survey telescopes in close proximity to the Earth, with roughly 3,000 new discoveries every year. Sometimes, these meteors come very close to Earthâ€™s future position and, because of small uncertainties in their positions, a future Earth impact cannot be completely ruled out. The last time a big meteorite crashed into Earth, it changed the climatic conditions so dramatically that it lead to the extinction of dinosaurs from Planet Earth.

 

Scientists have been studying about meteorites for a long time. The scientists have realized that applying Machine learning can help them identify the threats much more efficiently, 

 

Your Task is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether or not an asteroid will be dangerous (or not!).
